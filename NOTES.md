# Challenge!
How much of twitter/mastodon one person can implement in a weekend?

Ok, won't be the whole weekend I have two small children, and have to wantch new Marvel movie in the cinema, let's say 16h of coding.

# Programming language
Few choices:
- Python (I'm most familiar with, will be fastest to write)
- Golang (Great if we need a large in-memory cache and run it on fly.io later)
- Rust (ok things will be fast but it will take 10x time to write)

Our use case is most comparable to "multiple queries" one.
actix-http - 29,198
fasthttp - 18,967
fastapi - 12,406

So, for 2.5x speedup how much more developer time? I don't know for now, we will use Python :)

# Database
Scalable (dynamo paper)
Really only one choice: ScyllaDB - https://www.scylladb.com/

# Frontend
Really we need a minimal javascript, just to refresh the timeline, rest can be boring html.

# ActivityPub
Need a minimal implementation just so one can follow on external server and people can follow back.

# Large partition consideration
Current design will suffer once we get around 600,000 tweets per person or per timeline. These needs to bo solved by adding an addional key in all the tables to split partitions per day.
